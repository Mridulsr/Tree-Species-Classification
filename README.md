# Tree-Species-Classification

This project focuses on the classification of tree species using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various tree features such as height, diameter, leaf area, and possibly environmental attributes like soil type or location. The objective is to train a predictive model that can accurately identify the species of a tree based on these features. Additionally, the project includes a user-friendly Streamlit web application that allows users to upload new data and receive real-time predictions. This tool can be useful for botanists, environmental researchers, or forestry departments in identifying and cataloging tree species efficiently.
